Texts can be translated client-side with the help of <code>minetest.translate</code> and translation files.
</p>
<h2 id="Translating a string">Translating a string</h2>
<p>
Two functions are provided to translate strings: <code>minetest.translate</code> and <code>minetest.get_translator</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>minetest.get_translator(textdomain)</code> is a simple wrapper around   <code>minetest.translate</code>, and <code>minetest.get_translator(textdomain)(str, ...)</code> is   equivalent to <code>minetest.translate(textdomain, str, ...)</code>.   It is intended to be used in the following way, so that it avoids verbose   repetitions of <code>minetest.translate</code>:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local S = minetest.get_translator(textdomain)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S(str, ...)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As an extra commodity, if <code>textdomain</code> is nil, it is assumed to be "" instead.
</li>
<li>
<code>minetest.translate(textdomain, str, ...)</code> translates the string <code>str</code> with   the given <code>textdomain</code> for disambiguation. The textdomain must match the   textdomain specified in the translation file in order to get the string   translated. This can be used so that a string is translated differently in   different contexts.   It is advised to use the name of the mod as textdomain whenever possible, to   avoid clashes with other mods.   This function must be given a number of arguments equal to the number of   arguments the translated string expects.   Arguments are literal strings -- they will not be translated, so if you want   them to be, they need to come as outputs of <code>minetest.translate</code> as well.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, suppose we want to translate "@1 Wool" with "@1" being replaced
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by the translation of "Red". We can do the following:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local S = minetest.get_translator()
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S("@1 Wool", S("Red"))
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be displayed as "Red Wool" on old clients and on clients that do
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not have localization enabled. However, if we have for instance a translation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;file named <code>wool.fr.tr</code> containing the following:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@1 Wool=Laine @1
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red=Rouge
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be displayed as "Laine Rouge" on clients with a French locale.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Operations on translated strings">Operations on translated strings</h2>
<p>
The output of <code>minetest.translate</code> is a string, with escape sequences adding additional information to that string so that it can be translated on the different clients. In particular, you can't expect operations like string.length to work on them like you would expect them to, or string.gsub to work in the expected manner. However, string concatenation will still work as expected (note that you should only use this for things like formspecs; do not translate sentences by breaking them into parts; arguments should be used instead), and operations such as <code>minetest.colorize</code> which are also concatenation.
</p>
<h2 id="Translation file format">Translation file format</h2>
<p>
A translation file has the suffix <code>.[lang].tr</code>, where <code>[lang]</code> is the language it corresponds to. It must be put into the <code>locale</code> subdirectory of the mod. The file should be a text file, with the following format:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Lines beginning with <code># textdomain:</code> (the space is significant) can be used   to specify the text domain of all following translations in the file.
</li>
<li>
All other empty lines or lines beginning with <code>#</code> are ignored.
</li>
<li>
Other lines should be in the format <code>original=translated</code>. Both <code>original</code>   and <code>translated</code> can contain escape sequences beginning with <code>@</code> to insert   arguments, literal <code>@</code>, <code>=</code> or newline (See <a href="Translations.html#Escapes">Escapes</a> below).   There must be no extraneous whitespace around the <code>=</code> or at the beginning or   the end of the line.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Escapes">Escapes</h2>
<p>
Strings that need to be translated can contain several escapes, preceded by <code>@</code>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>@@</code> acts as a literal <code>@</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>@n</code>, where <code>n</code> is a digit between 1 and 9, is an argument for the translated   string that will be inlined when translated. Due to how translations are   implemented, the original translation string <em>must</em> have its arguments in   increasing order, without gaps or repetitions, starting from 1.
</li>
<li>
<code>@=</code> acts as a literal <code>=</code>. It is not required in strings given to   <code>minetest.translate</code>, but is in translation files to avoid being confused   with the <code>=</code> separating the original from the translation.
</li>
<li>
<code>@\n</code> (where the <code>\n</code> is a literal newline) acts as a literal newline.   As with <code>@=</code>, this escape is not required in strings given to   <code>minetest.translate</code>, but is in translation files.
</li>
<li>
<code>@n</code> acts as a literal newline as well.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Server side translations">Server side translations</h2>
<p>
On some specific cases, server translation could be useful. For example, filter a list on labels and send results to client. A method is supplied to achieve that:
</p>
<p>
<code>minetest.get_translated_string(lang_code, string)</code>: Translates <code>string</code> using translations for <code>lang_code</code> language. It gives the same result as if the string was translated by the client.
</p>
<p>
The <code>lang_code</code> to use for a given player can be retrieved from the table returned by <code>minetest.get_player_information(name)</code>.
</p>
<p>
IMPORTANT: This functionality should only be used for sorting, filtering or similar purposes. You do not need to use this to get translated strings to show up on the client.
